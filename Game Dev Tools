Game Dev Tools 

I will be talking about some game development tools that are both popular and unpopular. 

1. Gdevelop 
  -This a no-code game engine that is very popular among hobbyists and small development teams.
  - It is completely free of charge. 
  - Works alongside Piskel, which can be used in order to create and animate sprites for whatever game someone is trying to make. 
  - Pros: User friendly, plenty of resources to learn how to use it, small download size so it is able to be downloaded on laptops
  - Cons: Has difficulty handing projects of larger sizes, limited 3D capabilities, mainly for beginners instead of more experienced developers. 
2. Piskel
  - This is a free online editor specializing in pixel art.
  - Piskel works alongside Gdevelop as a way to design sprites within the game engine. 
  - Pros: Free, online so it is accessible to pretty much anyone, supports the ability to work offline.
  - Cons:
